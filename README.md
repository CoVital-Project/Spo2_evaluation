# SPO2 Evaluation

# Quick description of the packages:

## statistical Evaluation:

Pyton project implementing the statistical comparison method described (here)[https://www.overleaf.com/read/kwfmchzmmgtm]
to evaluate if a given algorithm is within the 2% accuracy necessary for accurate SpO2 estimation.

In short, the algorithm results are compared to the device measurements using Bland–Altman analysis. The rational for this choice is described in the paper referenced above.
