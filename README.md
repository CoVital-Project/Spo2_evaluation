# SPO2 Evaluation

Pyton project implementing the statiscal comparison method described (here)[https://www.overleaf.com/read/kwfmchzmmgtm]
to evaluate if a given algorithm is within the 2% accuracy necessary for accurate SpO2 estimation.

In short, the algorithm results are compared to the device measurements using Blandâ€“Altman analysis. The rational for this choice is described in the paper referenced above.
